                <h2>About me</h2>
                <h3>Full Stack Web Developer Student</h3>
                <p>I am 33 years old and currently residing in Capiz. I graduated in Capiz State University with Diploma in Computer Programming in 2007. Prior to 
                    joing KodeGo, I have a slight knowledge in terms of website development and design. Most of my job experience was about BPO and customer service.
                    I do however have knowledged with computer hardware since its inline with the training I received as a technical support representative. With KodeGo, I was able 
                    to refresh my knowledge with website designing. I am excited to be part of professionals who design and create websites which I can compare to a
                    work of art. I am not that creative however with practice I know I can achieve great things.
                </p>
                <p>In the future, I am planning of creating my own team that caters clients locally and abroad. With the experience and 
                    leadership skills I acquired working as call center agent, I am positive that I can achieve this. I understand that creating excellent results
                    require sacrifice and skills, I may not have the complete skills for now but I will do everything my power to achieve my goal.

                    <h2>Portfolio</h2>
                    <p>As a student of KodeGo, I created my version of the online library and this portfolio. We are required to submit projects in order
                        to practice our skills and also to ensure that we are competent to handle future projects once we are employed. This section will be 
                        updated once we complete future projects. I included the link and the brief description on how the project works.
